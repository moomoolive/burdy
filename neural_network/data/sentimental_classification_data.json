{"Opinion Unit": "Got one for my grandmother who is recently blind to aid in knowing what time it is, the temp, local and world news, local music, etc... and ended up getting another for myself because it was way too cool not to have one lol!!!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "If they on sale, just get one... do it... you wont regret it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's a speaker that'll keep you smiling for hours lol.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Great product, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but Alexa falls short in Canada.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This is a great little device, especially if you get it on sale.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I didn\u2019t care for having a powerful speaker as I already have a good sound system, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but the sound quality on this is actually quite good for what it is.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "More than enough to have background music on while entertaining or just doing stuff around the house.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "You get all of the functionality of Alexa for s much cheaper price.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Really handy if you already have some home automation devices.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Nothing like telling Alexa to boot up the Xbox, or turn the Christmas tree lights on and off!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Unfortunately, there seems to be some skills/capabilities that aren\u2019t available in Canada.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Things like the Xbox skill or the Apple Music service integration are what really sold me on finally getting one of these, only to find out that those things don\u2019t work in Canada (yet).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa also doesn\u2019t seem to track my amazon deliveries very well, often giving inaccurate information, even to what is indicated on my Amazon orders page.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "All-in-all, this is a great way to get the functionality of Alexa in your home for a cheaper price.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Really shines when you have home automation devices going.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I just hope that Amazon will expand the functionality of Alexa to us Canadians more in the future.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "A fun product.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The 3rd generation Echo Dot from Amazon feels like a very sturdy smart speaker assistant.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It was fairly easy to setup and fun to play around with.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The reason I did not give it 5 complete stars is two-fold: 1) I wish it could connect to my iTunes music collection.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "2) I wish it could connect to my music collection on Google Play (for this, I am not holding out my breath since Google is competition for Amazon).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "On another fun note, isn't it all the more exciting that all these smart assistants (from Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft) are collecting data from billions of people worldwide?", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Happy NSA listening!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Good sound for a tiny speaker.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I bought this to use as a bathroom speaker when I'm getting ready in the morning.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's small size makes it perfect to put on the vanity counter since it doesn't take up much room!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I was surprised how loud it can go!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I usually use volume 4 and can hear it over the shower perfectly.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Then I switch to volume 2 and it's perfect when I get out of the shower.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The quality of the sound is pretty good to.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The songs seem clear, and I don't get any distortion.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's way too convenient to use as well.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It can control my lights, vehicle block heaters, TV, ect.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I wish I had bought this sooner!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Literally straight out of the box.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Delighted with this addition to our other Echo pieces.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "No need for configuration, it found the wifi and connected automatically and within a minute I was playing my local radio station.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Now, each floor has an Echo, so no more moving the piece to where I am working.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa remains a little indifferent to my voice commands, unless I use my \"Jeffrey Cox\" voice, in which case, Alexa does things at the double.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Better than the older gen. With the 3rd gen, it seems more responsive than the previous versions and the new updates helps.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Speakers can be better, as it starts to crackle when you go above the 50% mark.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I have it in the master bedroom and would like to hear it while I'm in my walkin closet getting dress.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Overall, decent for the size and works well when it stays connected.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Useful as well as fun.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The general consensus is \"how did we live without this\".", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "After a few trial and errors with the questions we figured out what to ask.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Everyone instantly wanted one.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "As there are two birthdays coming in the next month I ordered two more.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I can see how useful this can be and why people enjoy having several throughout their homes.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I'm not sure if I want my house to be smart ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but for what I want, the Echo is a great addition.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Great product.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I'm giving a 5 even though I do have one issue which is really a 3rd party issue.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I bought additional echo's and one reason for this was the multi device music.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Yes it will do multi device music depending on the app you are streaming music from.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Amazon and spotify work great for this.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I'm also using Alexa Mymedia to stream songs from my own computer because I have a huge library of music and multi device will not work for this.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I hope to do something about this in the future.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I got these for a great price so I probably won't return the extra ones I purchased.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Other than that it's a great product and I recommend the Philips Hue lights.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "She is very dim witted.... You create play lists ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but she is off doing her own thing..  Not even close to what I have asked her to do..", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I have to change the names of my play lists because if you ask her to play list 2 (thunder &amp; lightening)  she comes back and starts to play UB40 or 40 top songs played on a Tuba.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Not conductive for sleep..She has a hard time with numbers.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I find my self fighting with a dot!!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "often!!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "so either she is not smart or i need to be committed ..", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "A brilliant addition to our home automation.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "We added this to extend our home automation into the bedroom by replacing our old alarm clock.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The setup and Alexa integration could not be easier!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Because I ordered from my Amazon account it was ready to go right out of the box.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The price was outstanding.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This is a lot of tech for the price.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The voice recognition is excellent.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The base features are excellent and skills keep getting better.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa is a good roommate.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "She tries hard to guess my music preferences and takes correction very well.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "A bit of a smart aleck about telling stories, though; and her jokes suck.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "She does set good boundaries which suggests sound emotional intelligence--if Alexa can't do  something she lets me know without a hissy fit.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa was easy to set up and connect to phone, and Youtube and Google has lots of info about how to Train Your Alexa with new skills.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I didn't turn on Drop In because that's just creepy.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Great product.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I actually got this to play music for my dog because it was on sale and cheaper then radios.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It works great for that she likes having tge music while im gone and i also enjoy the quick weather upadates as well as hockey.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Having the app and list function add directly to your phone is really helpfull also great for shopping lists.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Not perfect which is why i gave it 4/5 stars ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but a great buy.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "all in all..a smart little device worth the $50.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "i recommend the purchase for anyone who still uses your common radio as it requires little space and respond to simple every day questions..i certainly enjoy the multi timer function...i would recommend you subscribe to a music service provider such as Spotify if you wish to hear French songs as the selection on Amazon is quite limited and also requires a paid registration as well.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I also enjoy the feature of pairing one echo to another so that the same music can be heard in a different room..all in all a smart little device", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Works alright if you don't expect too much of it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The echo dot works okay, its not as good as equivalent Google products.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "For example: PROS: - You can customize it more with special add-ons, voice input/output prompts, etc.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "- It gets quite loud on max volume if you need that - Quality hardware (doesn't feel cheap or flimsy)  CONS: - Ask it to give you directions from point A to point B, it can't help.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "- Commonly intercepts conversations when you don't want/expect it to.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "- Doesn't accept many variations of questions to be comfortable speaking naturally to it - Can't seem to figure out how to pick proper audio/music albums from linked services such as Spotify or has issues when multi-devices are trying to use a single audio service account.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "SUMMARY: - Google is still light years ahead of the ECHO series in this technology category ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "although - I find the quality/hardware a bit nicer on the ECHO compared VS Google products even though they are similar.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Speaker buzzing.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The features and functionality of this speaker are fantastic.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Two things I don't like about it: 1.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The speaker buzzes occasionally which can be super annoying.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "2.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Unless you have a dedicated Spotify for it to work with.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It messes up your suggestions and Quick picks.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "So now most of Spotify suggests kids music instead of what I usually like.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's an OK quality speaker with some really cool smart features", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Love it!.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I love this thing, so much fun, fav music anytime, speakers load and clear, add things to my shopping list and sent straight to my phone so i never forget, answers ever dumb question i possibly could have plus has a fun game/triva interface to kill time.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Can't wait to get the lights and plug-ins to control more in my home.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Very God Product..", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I was accustomed to using a Google Mini ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but as a Prime subscriber, I decided to add Amazon Music and so bought the Dot.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's pretty good though I need to learn a bit of new language to get the news or the radio station that I want.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I only gave it a 4 stars because I think the larger model would have better sound, though this is not to say the sound is bad at all, it's just more limited.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7u peut \u00eatre endommag\u00e9 ?.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Je suis certain qu'il y a eu quelque chose avec le transport.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's a great new home assistant.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I'm very happy with this product.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I like that I can simply call its name, instead of saying hey Alexa or OK Google.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I really like how it integrates with all of my smart technology.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "You know have then assistant that continues to evolve.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Great technology!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I bought the echo dot first and the the home hub and an additional echo for the bedroom.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The I got one for my mother and a friend.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I love she is able to make calls and send messages to other units.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Amazing!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Gadget pas tr\u00e8s utile.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Je vois pas une grande utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce gadget.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "La seule pour moi c'est de faire jouer de la musique et le son est bien meilleur sur les mod\u00e8les plus gros que le echo dot alors je ne recommande pas vraiment ce produit.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "De plus les fonctions intelligentes sont limit\u00e9es et Alexa ne comprend pas toujours du premier coup.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Encore beaucoup d'am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 faire selon moi.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Amazing/Amusing.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "WE bought three - I have one in my shop, one in my office and one in my kitchen - it's a great hands-free intercom system.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "AT 74 anything can happen.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "But I MOST enjoy it for adding items to my shopping list as I am building -  the list is on my cel phone when I am in the appropriate stores.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "That's cool!!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "There is a lot more you can do - I just haven't had the time to learn all its tricks.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Good for the price!.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I'm not a technical person and this was easy to set up.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I also have the app on my phone which is wonderful.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The volume is not very loud at 10, I wish it would go louder so I could hear it throughout the condo.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Sometimes Alexa doesn't know the answers to simple questions which I'm guessing is due to the level of this Alexa.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Not a huge deal for me as I don't use Alexa for much.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Music, weather, reminders, timers for cooking and alarms for wake up.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Smart, Informative, and Fun !.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This AI device has surpassed what we expected, and we are enjoying it immensely.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "One should remember it is a computer and not a human being.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Not all actions are performed due to not understanding.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Think of it as a teenager when certain \"tough\" questions are asked.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Also, don't forget, it is listening all of the time.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Don't plan any third world coups, as you will be foiled.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Enjoy !", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Not the best buy..", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I bought this and for myself, it wasnt worth the money.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It goes through moments where it doesnt understand what I am saying and it can be really frustrating.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I tried to use some of the extra features like the kids stories for my children and only half the time it wants to co-operate.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The sound on it, isnt that great.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "If you want to play music on something, you would be better off buying a speaker.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Other things like the alarm you can set, you can barely hear with the volume on max.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I personally, wouldn't purchase another one.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Big Mistake!!!.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I hate that it doesn't have an input jack, only an output one.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "That wasn't clear from the description online when I bought it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "So basically, it doesn't do what I want it to do which is work as a speaker.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "What the hell would have been wrong with adding an input jack.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Secondly, it pairs with iphone, ipad, mac book pro, etc at first, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but to reconnect is a pain.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "And even when it says it is connected, no sound comes out.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This is a piece of junk as far as I am concerned.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The only good thing is the sound and voice recognition.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Google Home is better....", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Hate it, have a google home, way easier to use.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa requires way more voice commands to has the same duty performed as the google home.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "3rd party apps have to be added to the Alexa app and makes for privacy issues if worried about it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Always defaults to Amazon Music and Prime video instead of Netflix or Spotify.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Sound quality not too bad ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but her voice is too robotic and she is not as Web savy as google... nice try amazon...", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Would Buy again.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This was bought for a gift ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but have one of my own.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This item is my shopping list, to do list, day planner and appointment/event reminder and more.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Great for seniors.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "For such a small item the sound is pretty decent.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Con: if TV is on, one must speak louder for commands sometimes or get closer to the unit to repeat.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Double check your app because the unit sometimes prints illegible words if one does not enunciate clearly.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "So useful for such a small device.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Got one for myself at a pawn shop new in box and loved it so I bought this one for my parents.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Works great when it works.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Child likes to use it all the time and doesn't bother me to change songs for her.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Great for the kids room!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "They fall asleep to amazon's nature music okay list and it shuts itself off after the play list is complete; you're looking at about an hour of music.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "For 35 bucks or so that we paid over boxing week sales its a decent price even if we're only using it for music.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Love asking Alexa to play classical music in the kids room because they love to ballet lol.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Want to buy another one in the future when we buy a new home that has more smart features in it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Other than connecting the tv that's all we really have ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but you can buy attachments to plug in for lights, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but meh; just not their yet.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Maybe when I'm old and it's too hard to get up and shut the lights off myself lol", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Awesome , must have , best in home automation.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The best home assistant I have had.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I tried others like Google etc ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but Alexa beats all by a mile (atleast in understanding regular conversations).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "So far I have extended the home network going from one Alexa to one in every room.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Music sound quality is also very good.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa skills are good , ", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Very useful little gadget with decent sound and very easy to set up.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I use mine mostly for music, radio, and controlling lights.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "It just refuses to learn my voice, no matter how many times I \"teach\" it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Other than these two issues - the echo dot is as handy and helpful as you are will to make it; some routines take time to figure out; ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but having a series of events take place just by saying a single command is a brilliant thing, for e.g, a basic simple program of mine to the command of \"Good morning\" gives me the time, date, calendar and birthdays, weather, and breaking news - all for that day.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It then goes on to play the radio/playlist of my choice.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Overall it's worth every dollar!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Great for speakers and calling.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Alexa is good ", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "The sound quality is good for the price point, its small ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but mighty.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It recognized commands easily and works great.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "If I have one complaint, it is that it cannot be used wirelessly.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "In order for this to work I would have to unplug and replug this in, which I can do ", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Starting to grow on us!.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Ok well, after a few years of buying and returning, I had the Echo for free with the purchase of furniture and it grew on us, we don't use it at full capacity, however, we are now moving into a new home, so I decided to get the new DOT and Echo Plus and will start buying some smart stuff (light switches, plugs, etc...).", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "It crashes unexpectedly - sometimes several times a day and has to be reset.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "This only involves unplugging and replugging ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but a nuisance.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Another nuisance is that sound levels vary, depending on the source it accesses.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "One has to tell Alexis to reset desired sound volume.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The device will access only Amazon Kindle books in your e-book library, not those obtained free from Gutenberg, a public library or on a Kobo book app.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It will source music only from a purchased Amazon Prime account or a purchased Spotify account.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "It syncs well with other devices too and it will not auto connect another echo dot itself because of the security, we have to add it to the device before it can sync with the main Echo.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Google home or mini will connect with someone else Google device that is in range without even letting you know about it, which is really weird.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I know we can't expect this to make Coffee for you :) ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "But who know if it can make virtual Coffee, So I would say try it, It's the best in the market up till now.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Plug n Play and Rock and Roll!", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Clock.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It works just the same as other echo dots, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but with a clock, the light in the clock is quite dim, I can\u2019t read it with just daylight in my room, during the day you need to turn the light on to read it.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "At night I can read it ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but it is not very bright.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "So if you want a lighted clock, I would not by this again, for the clock.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Could be smarter.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "3 stars only because the range of devices it can be integrated with is very limited.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "You can't connect it to smart TV (and it's 21st century we are living in) unless you buy additional devices or download weird application (which was downloaded by 3 people before you) full of bugs and keep it working all the way on your phone.", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Disappointing, bought 4, once hype dies down, faulty problems started popping out.. Bought 4 echos, living in a small one bedroom so it\u2019s more than enough, got one in every corner of the house.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Been using it for a month now, loved it at first ", "Classification": null},

{"Opinion Unit": "Not bad, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but it still feels like an early-adopter gadget.. On its own, an Alexa is [unfortunately] not all that helpful.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "There are 3 main reasons for this: 1.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's designed to be part of an ecosystem.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "2.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "It's too heavily reliant on Amazon-specific services.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "3.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "[in my opinion] 'Routines' are where the potential is locked; until 3rd-Party creators go all-in to allow for more detailed and flexible user control, the potential will stay just that.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Having said all that, it's an evolving space, and as the hardware and software ecosystem grows, devices like this one will become more useful.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The echo dot 3 variant does a pretty decent at recognizing my voice, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but there are some voice commands where it seems to consistently misunderstand or misinterpret what I've actually said (like \"Illuminate the Batcave\"); maybe I have it set at too high of a spot (it's at around chin level).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Also, I like to use Plex for my music, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but that product appears to not be very well integrated, so Alexa instead decided to activate a free trial of Amazon Prime Music without my consent, which was frustrating [because the timing is horrible, so I won't even have the opportunity to explore it properly].", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Fortunately there is no credit card involved, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but it was still anxiety-inducing to have Alexa initiate that process and read the terms while I frantically protested (thus also leading me to not know what the terms even were).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "The audio quality is bearable, though nothing special, and [in my opinion] it looks rather nice relative to many other devices I've seen in this domain.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I got it for free on Black Friday, bundled with the Phillips Hue smart lights; the relationship between these two products really sets the tone, and the expectation is that all interactions will become that seamless in calibre with time (though, in large part, we're clearly not there yet).", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "I suffer from chronic migraines, so [being sensitive to basic stimuli in general] I look at all devices through the lens of someone who is perpetually feeling unwell and suffering.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "For such users, 'smart' functionalities and automation aren't so much viewed as a luxury as they are an extension of health-care when they provide support or relief.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "In Alexa's particular case, cutting down on screen time and putting more emphasis on voice prompts is helpful, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but the whisper mode hasn't yet had the level of success I'd hoped for, and this is another area where routines would really flourish if they were to be given more embrace by developers.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "All in all, the Alexa Echo Dot 3 is a neat step in the right direction as far as smart-home integration and automation is concerned, ", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "but it's teasing the future more than providing an established solution, ESPECIALLY used as a standalone unity.", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Aside from making the responses more successful and having deeper 3rd Party flexibility/compatibility, I hope we'll see Alexa interpret context and offer suggestions or solutions accordingly so that the experience will increasingly feel as though it were a natural interaction with a family member [rather than an authoritative/instructive \"do this, then that\" relationship].", "Classification": null},
{"Opinion Unit": "Scary voice comprehension.", "Classification": null},
