# Burdy
Voice of Customer Software

This is a git repository for all things related to the Burdy.

The 'Enviroment' folder is a folder that contains the virtual enviroment you will need to develop the script. I used virtualenv to create it.

Idea_testing_code is a folder where I try any relevant ideas to the software, like libraries, make prototypes for main program script.

The main_program_loop is as clear as day - it's the actual script that will be used in the back-end insha'Allah. DO NOT ADD TO THE SCRIPT THERE UNLESS YOU'RE COMPLETELY SURE IT WILL BE IN THE PROGRAM.
